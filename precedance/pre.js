/*
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

*/

// similar there are many precedence 

// simple example
const math = 1+9*2+(2+1)-1+9/3
console.log(math)
// precedence  level
/*
()
* and /
+ and -
*/ 
// now  test 
/*
(2+1)= 3
9*2 =18
9/3 = 3
1-1 =0
Add all----------------------
total =24
